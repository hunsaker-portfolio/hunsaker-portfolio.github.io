					<p>Here you can find some recent samples of my work: </p>
					<ul>
					  <li><a href="files/Interpersonal_Relations_and_the_QAnon_Movement.pdf">Political Science Research Paper: "Interpersonal Relations and the Qanon Movement"</a></li>
					  <li><a href="files/Virginia_Jail_Typology.pdf">Research Report: Virginia's Jails and their Administrative and Financial Sources</a></li>
					  <li><a href="files/Hunsaker_Film_Essay.pdf">Essay: Knowledge, Power, Paranoia - the History and Ideas of <i>The Conversation</i> (1974)</a></li>
					</ul>
					<p>These work samples span both my majors and my research assistant work. The first is a research paper that I completed for a political psychology class, the second is a research report that I completed while working as a research assistant, and the third is a media analysis essay that I wrote for a film class.</p>
					<p>The political science research paper focuses on the political psychology beneath the radical "QAnon" movement, contextualizing it in terms of interpersonal phenomena. The paper draws on theories of interpersonal social need and applies them to an online environment, in which misinformed radicals congregate and form bonds with one another. This was an interesting topic to research because of the peculiar dynamics of online interaction, where individuals may seek fulfillment of interpersonal needs to variable rates of success. As recent current events demonstrate, the political consequences of such groups are of increasing relevance.</p>
					<p>The research report focuses on the administrative and financial sources of Virginia's Jails. In my capacity as an assistant I would assemble research memos which sometimes were developed into more detailed reports, this one focused on the unique (and under-studied) administrative arrangement of jails in Virginia. The arrangement positions Virginia's jails as financial collaborations between the state and localities, though day-to-day administrative authority is vested almost entirely in local sheriffs. This makes for an interesting venue of differing incentives, as the practical sources of incarceration practices (judges and prosecutors) are almost entirely insulated from the financial consequences of their decisions.</p>
					<p>The last sample work, the essay, is an analysis of Francis Ford Coppola's 1974 film <i>The Conversation</i>. An enjoyable film that became one of my favorites, in this work I examine some of the philosophical implications of the film, drawing parallels between the surveillance processes shown in the movie and Michel Foucault's famed discussion of the panopticon.</p>
