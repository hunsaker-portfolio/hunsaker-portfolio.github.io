					<h2>Technical Communication</h2>
				</header>
				<section>
					<p>As a technical communicator, I am able to compose and transform purpose-oriented text. Below are three examples: an instructional video, an instructional document, and a usability report on the effectiveness of this document (and how it could be improved).</p>

					<h3>Video</h3>

				<section>
					<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-7FU0eWAS6c" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
					<p>This video gives instructions for using TransLoc, a transportation app that provides information about university shuttle services. I produced this video based on the written instructional guide below, both as part of a technical communication exercise in my ENGH 388 class.</p>

					<h3>Instructional Document</h3>
				</header>
				<section>
					<p>Here you can find an instructional document for the TransLoc app, which was the source of the information in the video:</p>
					<ul>
					  <li><a href="files/TransLoc_User_Guide.pdf">TransLoc User Guide</a></li>
					</ul>
					<p>This guide was written to be an effective instructional source, and then tested for usability. I first became acquainted with TransLoc through my work at the Transportation Office, these instructions are written to allow new users to be informed of the app's diverse functions and mechanisms. The results of the usability test are detailed in the Usability Test Report.</p>

					<h3>Usability Test Report</h3>
				</header>
				<section>
				  <p>Here I tested the usability of the instructional guide, and recommend modifications based on these tests:</p>
					<ul>
					  <li><a href="files/Usability_Report-_TransLoc_User_Guide.pdf">Usability Report: TransLoc User Guide</a></li>
					</ul>
					<p>The Usability Report was a unique exercise in the evaluation of a text based on actual testing. Oftentimes when authoring a text with a technical purpose, a writer must imagine a hypothetical reader receiving the instruction. In a usability test the reader is actualized and their response to the text may be recorded for analysis and improvement.</p>
