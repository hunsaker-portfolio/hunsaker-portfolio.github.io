					<h2>Research Interests</h2>
				</header>
				<section>
					<p>I have been fortunate to gain research experience as an undergraduate research assistant on a project that overlaps with my primary areas of interests. As I continue pursuing my own research and apply to graduate programs, these will be my primary areas of study.</p>
					<p>My research interests are:</p>
					  <ul>
					    <li>Political Philosophy</li>
					    <li>Political Theory</li>
					    <li>Political Economy</li>
					    <li>American Studies</li>
					  </ul>
					<p>Political philosophy and theory are two areas of focus where I hope to concentrate my work. In my undergraduate studies I complete a concentration in Law, Philosophy, and Governance, and also assisted on a project where historical instances were theorized as examples of political phenomena.</p>
					<p>Political economy and American studies are two other research areas where I am interested. I believe the American political ecosystem is a unique one, and its tendencies might be effectively analyzed through an economic lens. Examples of my previous research, including a political psychology research paper, are available in <a href="work_samples.html">Work Samples</a>.</p>
